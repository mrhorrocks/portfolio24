# About

Experienced Front-End Developer. I write well-structured semantic code, ensuring compatibility across various browsers. I am at my best when writing HTML, SASS or CSS to create user interfaces.

Most recently I have been working on statically generated Nuxt applications, and a WordPress theme that will be the ideal starting point for future WordPress projects. These projects can be found at my GitHub repository, https://github.com/mrhorrocks.

Some of my previous experience includes creating interactive and responsive web applications for pharmaceutical companies, developing websites in WordPress, Email campaigns and updating multiple websites. The tech I use to do this are are HTML, SASS, Vue.js, NUXT, Laravel, WordPress, JavaScript, jQuery, Adobe Suite and MySQL databases. I create wireframe prototypes in Figma. I am accurate, and I pay close attention to the details.

Interpersonal skills include articulating design and technical decisions, having a proactive approach to design challenges, and building rapport with clients and colleagues. Having a can-do approach and being able to multi-task, problem-solve, and work on several projects at the same time.

Experienced in agile development, particularly with merge requests, stand-ups, and using the Slack calendar and timeline to manage my own workload, create transparency, and break down projects into smaller, manageable tasks.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated closely with back-end developers, product managers, and marketing departments to transform design concepts into functional web applications.

My attention to detail and eye for design allow me to translate mock-ups and wireframes into pixel-perfect products. Also, my proficiency in version control systems like Git has facilitated smooth collaboration and code management within development teams.
