# About

Experienced Front-End Developer. I write well-structured semantic code, ensuring compatibility across various browsers. I can work in any code stack, and I am at my best when writing SASS or CSS to create user interfaces.

I have been focusing on statically generated Nuxt applications and a WordPress theme that will be the perfect starting point for future WordPress projects. I have published a portfolio and a GitHub repository. https://github.com/mrhorrocks.

My previous experience includes creating interactive and responsive web applications for pharmaceutical companies,  developing websites in WordPress, and updating multiple websites. Some of the tools I use are HTML, SASS, Vue.js, NUXT, Laravel, WordPress, JavaScript, jQuery, and charting libraries such as  Chartjs or Highcharts with SQL databases. I create wireframe prototypes in Figma. I am accurate, and I pay close attention to the details.

Interpersonal skills include articulating design and technical decisions, having a proactive approach to design challenges, and building rapport with clients and colleagues. Having a can-do approach and being able to multi-task, problem-solve, and work on several projects at the same time.

I have experience with agile development. Particularly with merge requests, stand-ups, and using the Slack calendar and timeline to manage my own workload, create transparency, and break down projects into smaller, manageable tasks.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated closely with back-end developers, product managers, and marketing departments to transform design concepts into functional web applications. 

My attention to detail and eye for design allow me to translate mock-ups and wireframes into pixel-perfect products. Also, my proficiency in version control systems like Git has facilitated smooth collaboration and code management within development teams.
