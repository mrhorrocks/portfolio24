Every Web Designer/Frontend Developer needs a good portfolio to showcases their skills.

From 2015 my work has solely been producing data driven dashboards on behalf of large pharmaceutical
companies such as Pfizer and J&J just to mention a few. Each and every project was confidential and not
accessible to the public.

I'm not at that company now, which presents me with a problem. How do I show off my stuff?

Welcome to mhox.net.
